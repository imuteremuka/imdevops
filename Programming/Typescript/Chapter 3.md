# Advanced Types

- Using a type alias we can create a new name (alias) for a type. We often use type aliases to create custom types.
- With union types, we can allow a variable to take one of many types (eg number | string).
- With intersection types, we can combine multiple types into one (eg Draggable & Resizable).
- Using optional chaining (?.) we can simplify our code and remove the need for null checks.
- Using the Nullish Coalescing Operator we can fallback to a default value when dealing with null/undefined objects.
- Sometimes we know more about the type of a variable than the TypeScript compiler. In those situations, we can use the as keyword to specify  
  a different type than the one inferred by the compiler. This is called type assertion.
- The unknown type is the type-safe version of any. Similar to any, it can represent any value but we cannot perform any operations on an unknown
  type without first narrowing to a more specific type.
- The never type represents values that never occur. We often use them to annotate functions that never return or always throw an error.

## Type alias

- type Employee = {
  - id:number;
  - name:string;
  - retire: (date:Date) =>void

## Union types

- let weight: number |string = 1;
- weight = '1kg';

## Intersection types

- type UIWidget = Draggable & Droppable;

## Literal types

- type Quantity = 50|100;

## Nullable types

- let name: string | null = null;

## Optional chaining (?.)

- customer?.birthdate?.getFullYear();
- customers?.[0];
- log?.('message');

## Nullish coalescing operator

- someValue ?? 30

## Type assertion

- objasPerson

## The Unknown Type

- function render(document:unknown)
- {
  // We have to narrow down to a specific type before we can perform any operations on an unknown type.
- if (typeof document === 'string') { }
  }

## The Never Type

- function processEvents():never {
  // This function never returns because it has an infinite loop.
- while (true) {}
  }

## Compiler Options

### strictNullChecks

- When enabled, null and undefined will not be acceptable values for variables unless you explicitly declare them as nullable.
- So, you’ll get an error if you set a variable to null or undefined

### allowUnreachableCode

- When set the false, reports error about unreachable code.
